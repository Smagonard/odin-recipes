            <li>1/2 cup warm water,</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt,</li>
            <li>200-250 gr. ground beef,</li>
            <li>1 onion,</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
            <li>250 gr yoghurt,</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic,</li>
            <li>Salt,</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter,</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste,</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons paprika,</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the flour in a large mixing bowl,</li>
            <li>Add in the salt and egg, then start mixing with your hand,</li>
            <li>Start adding the warm water while mixing and continue adding until everything comes
            together to form a non-sticky hard dough,</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with dump kitchen towel and let it rest for 20 mins,</li>
            <li>In the meantime, finely chop the onion,</li>
            <li>Mix together the ground beef, onion and black pepper,</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 4 pieces (cover the rest with dump kitchen towel while working with
            the first piece),</li>
            <li>Roll the first piece out using a rolling pan on a lightly floured surface to a 0.5 mm thick circle,</li>
            <li>Cut into 1x1 cm squares,</li>
            <li>Place a tiny amount of filling inside each square and fold from the corners,</li>
            <li>Prepare the rest of the dough,</li>
            <li>If you want to consume them right away, drop them in salted boiling water and cook
            until they rise on the surface of the water,</li>
            <li>If you want to store them for later, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment
            paper on a single layer and bake at 200 degrees celsius until the sides are golden, then
            place them in plastic freezer bags and freeze to boil later,</li>
            <li>For the sauce, crush the garlic cloves and mix them with yoghurt along with some salt,</li>
            <li>Melt the butter,</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 mins,</li>
            <li>Add in the paprika, stir and add the water,</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and remove from heat</li>
            <li>Serve the manti with garlic yoghurt sauce on top along with a small drizzle of 
            red butter sauce (you can also sprinkle on some dried mint or any other spices you like).</li>
