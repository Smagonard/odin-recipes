    <p class="paragraph">Sütlaç is a popular Turkish dessert that is similar to rice pudding. The dish is made with rice, sugar, and milk,
        which are simmered together until the rice is tender and the mixture is thick and creamy.
        The pudding is often flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, or rosewater, giving it a subtle and aromatic taste.
        Once the pudding is cooked, it is poured into individual serving dishes and then baked in the oven until the top is golden brown and slightly caramelized.
        Sütlaç is typically served cold and garnished with chopped nuts, such as pistachios or almonds, or with a sprinkle of cinnamon.
        It is a delicious and comforting dessert that is enjoyed throughout Turkey.</p>
    
        <h2 class="smallertop">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups water, or enough to cover rice</li>
            <li>4 3/4 cups plus 3 tablespoons whole milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="smallertop">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Heat the oven to 350 F / 180 C.</li>
            <li>In a colander, rinse the rice until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, add the rice and enough water to cover
                it by about 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat. Let the rice simmer
                gently until it's softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 3 3/4 cups of the milk along with the sugar and vanilla
                extract to the rice. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the
                heat and let it boil very gently for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, use a whisk to mix 1 cup of the milk and the
                cornstarch until smooth.</li>
            <li>While stirring, gradually pour the milk-cornstarch mixture into the rice.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat and continue stirring the pudding until
                scalding, about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the pudding thickens, continue to stir, and cook for about 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and fill small, ovenproof dessert cups,
                clay cups, or disposable aluminum pudding cups with the hot mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake the pudding cups until the tops are nicely browned, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the cups cool at room temperature and then refrigerate
                for several hours before serving. Enjoy.</li>
